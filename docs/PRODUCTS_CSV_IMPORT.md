### Installed Packages

- `csv-parser` - CSV parsing library

## API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/products/import`

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/products/import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@products.csv"
```

### Response Example

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"message": "Products imported successfully: 3 created, 0 failed",
	"data": {
		"summary": {
			"totalRows": 3,
			"processed": 3,
			"successful": 3,
			"failed": 0
		}
	},
	"statusCode": 201
}
```

## CSV Format Example

```csv
sku,name,description,category,supplier,retailPrice,sellingPrice,costPrice,images,details,metadata
ABC-123,Product Name,,electronics,TECH-001,99.99,89.99,75.00,"https://img1.jpg,https://img2.jpg","Feature 1,Feature 2,Feature 3","{""brand"":""Samsung"",""model"":""ABC-123""}"
```

**Note**: The CSV uses human-readable identifiers:

- `category` - Category slug (e.g., "electronics")
- `vendor` - Vendor code (e.g., "TECH-001")
- `description` - Optional general description
- `details` - Product features as comma-separated list
- `metadata` - Structured info as JSON

The system automatically looks up and uses the actual database IDs behind the scenes.

## How It Works

1. **Upload CSV**: Client uploads CSV file via multipart/form-data
2. **Parse CSV**: Server parses CSV using csv-parser
3. **Process Rows**: Each row is processed individually:
    - Look up category by slug to get categoryId
    - Look up vendor by code to get vendorId
    - Parse images (comma-separated → array of FEATURED images)
    - Parse details (comma-separated → specifications.details array)
    - Parse specifications (JSON string → object)
    - Convert prices to numbers
    - Validate with Zod schema
4. **Create Products**: Valid rows create products in database
5. **Error Handling**: Invalid rows are logged but don't stop import
6. **Response**: Returns summary with success/failure counts and error details

## Special Field Handling

### Images Field

```csv
images: "https://image1.jpg,https://image2.jpg,https://image3.jpg"
```

↓ Becomes:

```json
{
	"images": [
		{ "name": "image-1", "url": "https://image1.jpg", "type": "FEATURED" },
		{ "name": "image-2", "url": "https://image2.jpg", "type": "FEATURED" },
		{ "name": "image-3", "url": "https://image3.jpg", "type": "FEATURED" }
	]
}
```

### Details Field (Product Features)

```csv
details: "with FREE Kolin KCF. 07TMAGAC,Full DC Inverter for 60% Energy Savings,Multi-Stage Air Filtration"
```

↓ Becomes:

```json
{
	"specifications": {
		"details": [
			"with FREE Kolin KCF. 07TMAGAC",
			"Full DC Inverter for 60% Energy Savings",
			"Multi-Stage Air Filtration"
		]
	}
}
```

### Metadata Field

```csv
metadata: "{\"brand\":\"Kolin\",\"model\":\"K4G-100WCINV\",\"power\":\"1.0 HP\"}"
```

↓ Becomes:

```json
{
	"specifications": {
		"metadata": {
			"brand": "Kolin",
			"model": "K4G-100WCINV",
			"power": "1.0 HP"
		}
	}
}
```

### Complete Specifications Structure

```csv
details: "Feature 1,Feature 2"
metadata: "{\"brand\":\"Samsung\"}"
specifications: "{\"warranty\":\"2 years\"}"
```

↓ All merged into:

```json
{
	"specifications": {
		"details": ["Feature 1", "Feature 2"],
		"metadata": {
			"brand": "Samsung"
		},
		"warranty": "2 years"
	}
}
```

## Testing the Import

1. **Get Category Slugs** - Query your categories API to see available slugs (e.g., "electronics")
2. **Get Vendor Codes** - Query your vendors API to see available codes (e.g., "TECH-001")
3. **Edit the template CSV** with real category slugs and vendor codes
4. **Test with 1-2 products** first
5. **Upload via Postman** or cURL
6. **Check response** for any errors
7. **Import full dataset** once validated

### Getting Category Slugs

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/category?fields=slug,name"
```

### Getting Vendor Codes

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/vendor?fields=code,name"
```

## Error Handling

The import is designed to be fault-tolerant:

- ✅ Continues processing if individual rows fail
- ✅ Returns detailed error messages
- ✅ Includes row numbers for easy debugging
- ✅ Validates all data before creation
- ✅ Logs all activities

## Next Steps

1. Get available category slugs and vendor codes from your database
2. Update `category` and `vendor` in the CSV template with real slugs/codes
3. Add your product data to the CSV
4. Test the import with a small batch
5. Review the response and fix any errors
6. Import your full product catalog

## Example: Category & Vendor Lookup

When you input in CSV:

```csv
category,vendor
electronics,TECH-001
```

Behind the scenes, the system:

1. Looks up category with slug "electronics" → gets ID `6965b347a951da4abd50852a`
2. Looks up vendor with code "TECH-001" → gets ID `6965e763e90c14d58d807bb3`
3. Creates product with these IDs
