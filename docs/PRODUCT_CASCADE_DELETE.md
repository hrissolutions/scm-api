# Product Cascade Delete Configuration

## Overview

When a Product is deleted, all related data will be automatically deleted (CASCADE).

## Cascade Delete Relations

### ✅ Will Be Deleted Automatically

When you delete a Product, these related records are automatically deleted:

1. **CartItem** 🛒
    - User shopping cart items containing this product
    - **Impact**: Users lose this product from their carts
    - **Risk Level**: ⚠️ Low - Expected behavior

2. **OrderItem** 📦
    - Order line items for this product
    - **Impact**: Historical order data is deleted
    - **Risk Level**: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **HIGH** - Loses order history!

3. **Purchase** 💰
    - Employee purchase records (payroll loans, etc.)
    - **Impact**: Financial/purchase history is deleted
    - **Risk Level**: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **HIGH** - Loses financial records!

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Deleting Products Will:

1. **Delete Order History**
    - All OrderItems referencing this product will be deleted
    - Orders may have incomplete data
    - Historical sales reports will be affected
    - **Solution**: Consider soft delete instead

2. **Delete Purchase Records**
    - Employee purchase history will be lost
    - Payroll loan records will be deleted
    - Financial auditing may be impacted
    - **Solution**: Consider soft delete instead

3. **Cannot Be Undone**
    - Once deleted, data cannot be recovered
    - No backup/restore mechanism
    - **Solution**: Always backup before bulk deletions

## Recommended: Soft Delete Instead

Instead of hard deleting products, consider using the `isActive` flag for soft delete:

### Soft Delete (Recommended)

```typescript
// Soft delete - product still exists but hidden
await prisma.product.update({
	where: { id: productId },
	data: {
		isActive: false,
		isAvailable: false,
		isFeatured: false,
	},
});
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Preserves order history
- ✅ Preserves purchase records
- ✅ Can be restored later
- ✅ Historical reports remain accurate
- ✅ Audit trail maintained

**Filtering in Queries:**

```typescript
// Get only active products
const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
	where: { isActive: true },
});
```

### Hard Delete (Current Implementation)

```typescript
// Hard delete - deletes product and ALL related data
await prisma.product.delete({
	where: { id: productId },
});
```

**Consequences:**

- ❌ Deletes order items
- ❌ Deletes purchase records
- ❌ Loses historical data
- ❌ Cannot be undone
- ❌ May break reports

## Schema Configuration

### Current Configuration

```prisma
// orderItem.prisma
model OrderItem {
  product   Product @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
}

// cartItem.prisma
model CartItem {
  product    Product @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
}

// purchase.prisma
model Purchase {
  product Product @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
}
```

### Alternative: Restrict Historical Data

If you want to protect historical data, change OrderItem and Purchase to:

```prisma
// Protect historical data
model OrderItem {
  product   Product @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict, onUpdate: Cascade)
}

model Purchase {
  product Product @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict, onUpdate: Cascade)
}
```

This will prevent deletion if orders or purchases exist for the product.

## Migration

After updating the schema, run:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma-generate

# Create and apply migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_product_cascade_delete

# Or for production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Usage Examples

### Check Before Deleting

```typescript
// Check what will be deleted
const productData = await prisma.product.findUnique({
	where: { id: productId },
	include: {
		orderItems: { take: 1 },
		purchases: { take: 1 },
		cartItems: { take: 1 },
	},
});

console.log(`Will delete:
  - ${productData.orderItems.length > 0 ? "Has order history" : "No orders"}
  - ${productData.purchases.length > 0 ? "Has purchase history" : "No purchases"}
  - ${productData.cartItems.length > 0 ? "In shopping carts" : "Not in carts"}
`);
```

### Safe Delete with Confirmation

```typescript
async function safeDeleteProduct(productId: string) {
	// Count related records
	const [orderCount, purchaseCount] = await Promise.all([
		prisma.orderItem.count({ where: { productId } }),
		prisma.purchase.count({ where: { productId } }),
	]);

	if (orderCount > 0 || purchaseCount > 0) {
		throw new Error(
			`Cannot delete product: ${orderCount} orders and ${purchaseCount} purchases will be lost. Use soft delete instead.`,
		);
	}

	// Safe to delete
	await prisma.product.delete({ where: { id: productId } });
}
```

### Bulk Soft Delete

```typescript
// Soft delete all inactive/old products
await prisma.product.updateMany({
	where: {
		updatedAt: { lt: new Date("2020-01-01") },
		stockQuantity: 0,
	},
	data: {
		isActive: false,
		isAvailable: false,
	},
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Use Soft Delete for Products with History**
    - If product has orders or purchases, use soft delete
    - Hard delete only for newly created products with no history

2. **Implement Deletion Checks**
    - Check for related data before deletion
    - Warn users about data loss
    - Require confirmation for products with history

3. **Backup Before Bulk Operations**
    - Always backup database before bulk deletions
    - Test deletions on staging environment first

4. **Use Transaction for Related Deletions**

    ```typescript
    await prisma.$transaction([prisma.product.delete({ where: { id: productId } })]);
    ```

5. **Log Deletion Events**
    - Log what was deleted for audit trail
    - Include user who performed deletion
    - Track deleted product IDs

## Monitoring

Keep track of deletions:

```typescript
// Count products by status
const stats = await prisma.product.groupBy({
	by: ["isActive"],
	_count: true,
});

console.log("Active products:", stats.find((s) => s.isActive)?._count);
console.log("Inactive products:", stats.find((s) => !s.isActive)?._count);
```

## Rollback

If you need to revert to Restrict mode:

1. Update schemas back to `onDelete: Restrict`
2. Run: `npx prisma migrate dev --name revert_cascade_delete`
3. Handle deletion attempts with proper error messages
