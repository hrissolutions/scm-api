# CSV Import Fields Update

## What Changed

Updated the CSV import to better organize product information with clearer separation between description, features, and metadata.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Description is Now Optional** ✅

- The `description` field is now truly optional
- Can be left empty if product features tell the whole story
- Use for general product summary when needed

### 2. **Details = Product Features** ✨

The `details` field is specifically for customer-facing product features (bullet points):

**Example:**

```csv
details: "with FREE Kolin KCF. 07TMAGAC,Full DC Inverter for 60% Energy Savings,Multi-Stage Air Filtration"
```

This matches what customers see in product listings:

- ✓ with FREE Kolin KCF. 07TMAGAC
- ✓ Full DC Inverter for 60% Energy Savings
- ✓ Multi-Stage Air Filtration

### 3. **New Metadata Field** 🆕

Added dedicated `metadata` field for structured product information:

**Example:**

```csv
metadata: "{""brand"":""Kolin"",""model"":""K4G-100WCINV"",""power"":""1.0 HP"",""type"":""Window Type""}"
```

Use for:

- Brand
- Model
- Product type
- Power/capacity
- Color
- Size
- Any structured attributes

### 4. **Specifications Field** 📋

Keep using `specifications` for additional technical specs:

**Example:**

```csv
specifications: "{""warranty"":""1 year"",""energyRating"":""5 star"",""voltageRange"":""220-240V""}"
```

## Updated CSV Structure
